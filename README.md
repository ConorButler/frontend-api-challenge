Challenge:
-------

Single page app Twitter clone using makers Chitter API.
[The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports and the ones I have implemented:

* ✔ Creating Users
* ✔ Logging in
* ✔ Posting Peeps
* ✔ Viewing all Peeps
* Viewing individual Peeps
* ✔ Deleting Peeps
* ✔ Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

## Using the app

```
git clone https://github.com/ConorButler/frontend-api-challenge.git
cd frontend-api-challenge
npm install
node app.js
```

## Notes
* Refreshing resets the page and the session
* Some errors aren't handled correctly and it appears you can do things that haven't actually gone through to the server
* Click anywhere on the background to close a modal

# Major refactoring needed

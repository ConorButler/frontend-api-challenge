Challenge:
-------

Single page app Twitter clone using makers Chitter API.
[The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports and the ones I have implemented:

* ✔ Creating Users
* ✔ Logging in
* ✔ Posting Peeps
* ✔ Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* ✔ Deleting Peeps
* ✔ Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

## Using the app

```
git clone https://github.com/ConorButler/frontend-api-challenge.git
cd frontend-api-challenge
npm install
node app.js
```

# Major refactoring needed
